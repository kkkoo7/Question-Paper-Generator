"# Question-Paper-Generator"

The question bank consists of 3 types of question i.e. easy, medium and hard based on difficulty level. Each question has a unique identifier i.e. question_id, marks and difficulty level associated with it. Question bank also consists of the criteria based on which paper should be generated. Parameters are Total Marks, % of marks carried by easy question, % of marks carried by medium level question, % of marks carried by tough question.

Based on the parameters, it generates a question paper. The selection of questions are being done randomly. i.e for a particular criteria, the program would generate a different set of question paper each time on being run.

To run the program, you need to have Python installed. Clone the project, enter the directory and run the script using "python question_generator.py"
